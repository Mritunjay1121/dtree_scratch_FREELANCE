Decision Trees 

I will tell you in step by step how you have to run dtree file to train the models.

1. You need to install some important libraries , scikit-learn, pandas and numpy

2. We will have to run the dtree.py file from the command line client for training and testing purpose.

3. The command is as follows:

python dtree_second.py <training_file> <test_file> option

Here ,
training_file could be pendigits_training  or satellite_training or yeast_training.
test file could be pendigits_test or satellite_test or yeast_test.
option could be optimized or randomized or forest3 o forest15

It will first train the model on training data and then print the accuracy for each object on the testing data and then finally print the Classification Accuracy
